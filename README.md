# CRUD_using_ExpressJS
The index.js file in the code above has APIs for Create, Rename, Update, and Delete (CRUD). I tested the APIs using Thunderclient, a Visual Studio Code Extension.
Port 3003 is where the express server is located.
There isn't a front end because I tested the APIs locally on Thunderclient; however, you can build one by using the express navigations for home pages and other pages.

The code above only represented the reasoning behind how CRUD operations are created in Express.
